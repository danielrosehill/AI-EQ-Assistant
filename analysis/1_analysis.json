    "analysis_notes": "The speaker\u2019s slower tempo and higher melodic intonation strongly suggest an Irish English accent. The manner in which certain consonants (like 'th') are softened, combined with non-rhoticity and vowel length distinctions, points to a Southern Irish dialect. The tone of the speaker was quite reflective and calm, which aligns with common speech patterns of people from Ireland, particularly in more rural or suburban regions."
