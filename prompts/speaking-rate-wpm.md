# Speaking Rate / Words Per Minute Analysis

## Prompt

```
Listen to the voice sample I've provided and analyze the speaking rate.

Please provide:

1. **Estimated Words Per Minute (WPM)**
   - Calculate the approximate WPM based on the speech in the sample
   - Note: Average conversational speech is 120-150 WPM, professional narration is typically 150-170 WPM

2. **Pacing Assessment**
   - Is the pace consistent throughout, or does it vary?
   - Are there natural pauses, or does the speech feel rushed/dragged?
   - Rate the pacing on a scale of 1-5 (1=too slow, 3=ideal, 5=too fast)

3. **Syllable Rate**
   - Estimate syllables per second if possible
   - Note any patterns in syllable timing

4. **Recommendations**
   - Is this pace appropriate for the apparent use case (podcast, narration, presentation)?
   - Suggestions for improvement if applicable

Format your response as a structured report with clear sections.

## What This Analyzes

- **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: The core speaking speed metric
- **Pacing consistency**: Whether the speaker maintains steady rhythm
- **Pauses and breath timing**: Natural vs awkward pauses
- **Suitability for content type**: Different formats require different pacing

## Typical Ranges

| Context | WPM Range |
|---------|-----------|
| Conversational | 120-150 |
| Audiobook narration | 150-170 |
| Podcast (casual) | 140-170 |
| News/professional | 160-180 |
| Auctioneering | 250+ |
