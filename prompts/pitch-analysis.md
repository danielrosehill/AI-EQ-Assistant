# Pitch / Fundamental Frequency (F0) Analysis

## Prompt

```
Listen to the voice sample I've provided and analyze the pitch characteristics.

Please provide:

1. **Fundamental Frequency (F0) Estimation**
   - Estimated mean pitch in Hz
   - Approximate pitch range (lowest to highest Hz observed)
   - Note: Typical male voice is 85-180 Hz, female voice is 165-255 Hz

2. **Pitch Variability**
   - Is the pitch monotone or varied?
   - Rate the pitch variation on a scale of 1-5 (1=monotone, 3=natural variation, 5=highly expressive)
   - Note any patterns (upward inflections, downward trends, etc.)

3. **Intonation Patterns**
   - Describe the intonation style (declarative, questioning, engaging, etc.)
   - Are there any problematic patterns (uptalk, vocal fry, etc.)?

4. **Voice Register**
   - Is the speaker using their natural register or appears strained?
   - Chest voice vs. head voice observations

5. **Recommendations**
   - Suggestions for pitch-related improvements
   - Any concerns about vocal strain or unnatural pitch patterns

Format your response as a structured report with clear sections. Include Hz values where possible.

## What This Analyzes

- **Mean F0**: The average fundamental frequency of the voice
- **Pitch range**: How much the voice varies from low to high
- **Pitch variability**: Monotone vs. expressive delivery
- **Intonation**: Rising/falling patterns and their appropriateness
- **Register usage**: Whether the speaker is in their natural range

## Typical F0 Ranges

| Voice Type | Typical Range (Hz) |
|------------|-------------------|
| Bass | 80-150 |
| Baritone | 100-180 |
| Tenor | 130-260 |
| Alto | 175-275 |
| Soprano | 250-500 |
