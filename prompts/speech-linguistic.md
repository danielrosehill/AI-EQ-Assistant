# Speech and Linguistic Analysis

## Prompt

```
Listen to the voice sample I've provided and analyze the speech and linguistic characteristics.

Please provide:

1. **Accent Identification**
   - Primary accent/dialect identification
   - Regional characteristics if detectable
   - Native vs. non-native speaker assessment
   - Accent strength/prominence (subtle, moderate, strong)

2. **Pronunciation Assessment**
   - Overall pronunciation clarity (1-5 scale)
   - Any specific phonemes that are unclear or non-standard
   - Consonant clarity
   - Vowel quality and consistency

3. **Articulation Quality**
   - Rate of articulation
   - Precision of consonants
   - Mouth opening/jaw movement (sounds open or mumbled?)
   - Any slurring or running together of words

4. **Prosody Analysis**
   - Rhythm and timing patterns
   - Stress patterns (word stress, sentence stress)
   - Intonation contours
   - Naturalness of prosodic features (1-5 scale)

5. **Speaking Style**
   - Formal vs. casual register
   - Confidence level in delivery
   - Engagement and expressiveness
   - Pace appropriateness for the style

6. **TTS/STT Suitability**
   - Suitability for text-to-speech training (1-5 scale)
   - Suitability as a reference for speech recognition
   - Clarity for automated transcription
   - Any features that would complicate machine processing

7. **Recommendations**
   - Areas for pronunciation improvement
   - Articulation exercises if applicable
   - Style adjustments for different contexts

Provide specific, actionable observations that would help the speaker understand their speech patterns.

## What This Analyzes

- **Accent and dialect**: Regional and linguistic background markers
- **Pronunciation**: How clearly individual sounds are produced
- **Articulation**: Physical production of speech sounds
- **Prosody**: Rhythm, stress, and intonation patterns
- **Speaking style**: Register, confidence, and expressiveness
- **Machine learning suitability**: For TTS training or STT accuracy

## Common Accent Markers to Note

| Feature | What to Listen For |
|---------|-------------------|
| Rhoticity | R-dropping or R-coloring |
| T-flapping | American "butter" vs British "butter" |
| Vowel shifts | Regional vowel differences |
| Consonant clusters | Simplification or preservation |
| Intonation | Rising/falling patterns |
| Rhythm | Stress-timed vs syllable-timed |
